# simple-backup
A simple backup script written in Python that only copies new or updated files. It will create and mirror subdirectory structures as well.

## Usage
- Update the config.ini file with the Source directory you want to backup and the Backup directory that will be used.
- Run.

## Future Updates
- Remove files from the Backup directory that are no longer found in the Source directory to keep the two synchronized.
- Allow multiple Source directories and the ability to ignore configured subdirectories.
